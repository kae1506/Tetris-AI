# Using reinforcement learning to beat the classic game Tetris

Using different variations of DQN to study and beat the classic block game Tetris

Tetris faces the issues of lack of correlation between action and reward, and thus we use different variations of Deep Q Learning to study which performs the best. Specifically, Double Deep Q Learning (DDQL) and Deuling Double Deep Q Learning (DDDQL)
models are used. Neither so far tend to beat the game, but it is still qualitative to study which is able to bridge which gaps.

Deuling so far creates the best situations but tends not to finish well. 

All algorithms and environments have been hand-written by me.
